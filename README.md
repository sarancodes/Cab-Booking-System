# Cab-Booking-System
A simple cab booking system made in java using concepts like exceptions,packages and inheritence.

I had implemented the program through various packages which are very useful in organizing the code.
I had named the files according to their relevant functions.

For demographic purposes I had made some prebuilt models which acts as the information given by the user to process the program.
